## Introducion
This repository documents my attempt at building a custom mechianical keyboard. I have been been considering switching to a split ergonomical keyboard such as the [Ergodox](https://ergodox-ez.com/) for a while now.
I hestitated, mostly because I love my current Varmillo Mechianical keyboard and I was not sure if switching back and forth between the two would be a good idea. At the end I deciced it was more about learning the process of building a custom keyboard than actually using it. So I decided to build a custom keyboard from scratch.

The requirements I had were simple, a split mechanical keyboard with the base laout as close to the ISO layout as possible to make switching back and forth as painless as possible. Why ISO? Because I use a Swedish/Norwegian keyboard which uses the ISO layout.

## The layout
I used the [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/) to create the layout. It's based on the ISO 60% preset, but includes the top row with a couple of functional keys. I will explain why I needed the top row later on when we get to the PCB design.

The raw layout can be foud [here](layouts/layout.kle).
